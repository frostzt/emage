<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/I6D0nQI.png)

This project uses two APIs both of Imgur and Emage (API is included). The original application that you find here is hosted on Heroku, therefore the data is lost after every server restart or recompile. (I'll talk about this in more detail at last)

- Check it here: [Emageical](https://emageical.herokuapp.com/)

### Built With

<!-- This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Here are a few examples.-->

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Expressjs](https://expressjs.com/)

## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

This application helps you host your images and modify them in few properties.

- Uses Imgur API for hosting images (No account or signup required)
- Also has built-in API but the storage on heroku is ephemeral therefore the data is lost after a recompile or restart.

## How To Use

<!-- Example: -->

To clone and run this application, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. From your command line:
